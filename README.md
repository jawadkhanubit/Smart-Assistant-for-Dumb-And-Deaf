# Smart-Assistant-for-Dumb-And-Deaf
It is an artificially intelligent system which we develop by using Machine learning and Deep Learning.

# Abstract
There are many people in all over the world and in our country as well who can’t speak. They feel very miserable when they try to convey their message to the normal peoples so they always needs a person who knows their sign language and then this person conveys their message to the normal people so due to fulfill this requirement we want to build a system through which they can easily convey their message to the normal people without any third person involved. 

# Data Set
Data is so precious in Machine Learning and Deep Learning without data we can’t do any thing so first of all we develop our own data set it’s a very difficult task by taking images in a huge quantity and extract just sign from these images we spend a huge time in developing data set for our model. Our data set contain 300 x 300 size images of five classes ‘I need help’, ‘I feel pain’, ‘I need water’, ‘Yes’ and ‘No’.

Some Images of our dataset:
